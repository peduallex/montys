    Montys consist of these files

    Python  
        You need to have access to Python 1.5.2
        
    PIL     Python Imaging Library
        Montys uses PIL to automatically create thumbnails. You need PIL 1.0 
        or higher installed. NB! Depending on the kind of images you will handle
        both the actual postcard image and the thumbnail. You may need to include 
        GIF and/or JPEG support in PIL

    HTMLgen 
        Montys uses HTMLgen to create the HTML pages. You need HTMLgen 2.2
        or higher
        
        
    Montys Package         
        __init__.py 
        PServer.py      
        CONST.PY

    CGI         
        Postcard.cgi [1]
        Createcard.cgi 
        Sendcard.cgi
        
    HTML templates
        previewcard.html
        createcard.html
        postcard.html
        thanks.html


    install the package into one of the directories on the $PYTHONPATH into a 
    subdirectory called Montys. The html-template files shall also be 
    installed into this directory.
    
    e.g.
        site-packages/Montys

    The CGI files should be installed into the cgi-bin directory of your web 
    account. Remember to change the first line so that it point to the actual 
    directory where python is installed. You must also make the files 
    executable!

    Now you have to change all the constants that are defined in the CONST.PY 
    file

    
    At last create a link which points to the 'Postcard.cgi'

                                    -------------
                                    
Thumbnails 
    Montys will automatically create a thumbnail of the image. This thumbnail 
    will be saved in a subdirectory called '.thumbnail'. Having thumbnails will 
    speed up the showing of the images by many 100% and will not take much space. 
    It may cause some distortion of the picture but usually it will be good enough
    for selecting.


HTML Template 

Montys is using HTMLgen to create the html pages. This means that 
you can create the templates using your standard and using some HTML-
application, i.e. Frontpage, Dreamweawer,etc. The only thing Montys cares about 
is the name of the html-page and a couple of tags.

    The first HTML page is called 'previewcard.html'. 

    This will show a table of all the images that is in the start directory. 
    if there are any subdirectories it also will show them as a image grouping 
    or category. You have to place two tags on this page:

        {mpDirtable}            Will be replaced with a table of categories                                 
                                Each Category is also a link and will take 
                                the user to the category,showing all 
                                subcategories and images.

        {mpPreviewtable}        Will be replaced with a table of 
                                images/Thumbnails The thumbnail is 
                                linked to Createcard.py, which will 
                                ask for recipient and sender and 
                                message and such



    'createcard.html'

    This page will show the image (not the thumbnail) and should have a form for 
    filling out the name and email addresses of the sender and receiver. There 
    should also be a text field for the message.
    
    {mpPicture}                 The image
    
    {mpFormAction}              The form action. NB! The method MUST be POST!
    
    The fields in the form MUST be named:
    <input name="image" type="hidden" value="{mpPicture}">  #so the next cgi know which image
    <input name="rname" type="text" value="">               #receiver name
    <input name="rmail" type="text" value="">               #receiver email address
    <input name="sname" type="text" value="">               #sender name
    <input name="smail" type="text" value="">               #sender email address
    <textarea name="message" rows=10 cols=60 >              #Message

footnote

    [1] I don't know why but if you're using Xitami on Windows you need to     
        rename these files from .CGI to .py! Otherwise Xitami will not recognize 
        them as CGI applications. if you know how to get this to work please let 
        me know!!
